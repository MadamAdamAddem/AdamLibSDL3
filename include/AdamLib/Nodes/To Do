General:
  -Establish definitive naming conventions

Node Template:
  -Change node instance's name upon instantiation, to avoid duplicate names

Node:
  -Add on-ready node initialization.
    Ex: Node* n_node = get_node_on_ready(..., &n_node);
    Returns nullptr if node not ready or existent
    When node is loaded, fill n_node with ptr to node?

  -Solve node being able to have (itself or parent) as indirect child
  -Solve node being able to have (itself or child) as indirect parent

  -Optimize node-path system

  -Make functions relating to path/name more cohesive (move towards path instead of name)

SpriteNode:
  -Figure out how to make image clips easier


CollisionNode:
  -Finish all collision types
